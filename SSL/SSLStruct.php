/**
 * SSL Structs, e.g. Track, are concrete data structures that model actual data
 * from SSL. This representation is decoupled from chunk types that the data is
 * stored in, for reasons of polymorphism. (@see SSLChunk).
 * 
 * Usually a DOM that's context specific will pass expected SSLStructs into 
 * encountered SSLChunks to extract data from them when parsing the file. 
 * That way, SSLChunks don't have to know any semantics about their own data, and 
 * SSLStructs don't have to know anything about the container format of the Chunks.
 *  
 * The different between SSLChunk and SSLStruct is therefore semantic: an SSLStruct 
 * represents well formed destination data that can be constructed from an SSL binary 
 * file. SSLChunk, on the other hand, represents an actual block of binary data.
 * Normally you would pass a Struct into a Chunk and ask the Chunk to fill the Struct
 * out with actual data, using an Unpacker that the Struct provides to do the actual
 * conversion.
 * 
 * As a concrete example of why I chose this scheme, SSL's history files contain a
 * number of ADAT chunks, that in turn contain track history data. However there's
 * no particular reason why an ADAT chunk has to contain track data; ADAT chunks
 * appear to contain array data with numbered fields, and it's the fact that we're
 * expecting to see tracks in a history file that requires them to be interpreted
 * as such.
