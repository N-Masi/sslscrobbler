/**
 * Represents a Track found in an SSL history file. (There may be other 
 * representations of Tracks found in other SSL files).
 * 
 * SSL puts a lot of useful information into the history file, including
 * the full path to the MP3, bpm, key, etc., as well as history-oriented data
 * such as start and end time, which deck the track was played on, played or 
 * skipped, manually added, etc. There is also an incrementing integer primary 
 * key (which I've called 'row').
 * 
 * History file Tracks also have a concept of their own 'status', in the sense of
 * 'NEW', 'PLAYING', 'PLAYED' or 'SKIPPED'. (@see SSLRealtimeModel for more detail).
 * These states are derived from a combination of the 'played' field, which is
 * either 0 or 1 corresponding to whether or not the row is 'green' in the SSL
 * interface, and whether or not an 'endtime' is present.
